## Chapter 3:  Introspecting HPA

### WTH is HPA?

- It is integral native object and widely used feature in the K8s, available as part of every major distribution of K8s.
- HPA simplifies the task of managing the number of Pod Replicas in `Deployment, Replicaset, Stateful Sets`.
- It automatically functions by scaling the replicas in response to some observed metrics.
- HPA operates by monitoring the specified metrics and comparing them against the predefined thresholds.

```bash
Metrics exceeds threshold then it Scales-OUT α Increase Pod Replicas

Metrics goes below threshold then it Scales-DOWN α Decrease Pod Replicas

NOTE: This Increasing the Count and Decreasing the Pods Replicas are set using the minReplicas and maxReplicas.
```
Such dynamic adjustment ensures that application has sufficient resources when it needs them without over-provisioning.

**NOTE:** Before moving with the HPA that we need to install the Kube Metrics Server it is the native K8s object which is present on all the distributions of K8s `but just not installed.`

#### HPA Workflow:

- HPA periodically receives the metrics where metrics acts as major data-point stating the current vs desired state acquired by the app.
- Desired Replicas could be gotten from the formula below ; ciel (mathematical context) is used to get the whole number.
- Once the Desired Replicas are calculated HPA can adjust the replica count where the maximum ceiling it can go is the `maxReplicas` set and lowest to the `minReplicas`.
- After the `Scaling Out / Scaling Down` there is some `cool-down` period (which is configurable) to help stabilizing the scaling process, preventing rapid replication in replica count.

### Metrics Types in HPA
<Image alt="HPA Visualisation" src="/static/images/types-metrics-2.jpg" width={1000} height={1000} />

- **A> Resource Metrics:** Fundamental to K8s Autoscaling included the `CPU and Memory metrics`; `this can suffice our basic scaling needs`.

- **B> Custom Metrics:** More Granular /Tailored Approach to scaling; these metrics are derived from external sources and custom monitoring solution
eg. > Queue Length or Transaction Rate can be pivotal for apps where factors are critical performance indicators.

Custom Metrics allow HPA to respond to specific needs of an application, scaling resources in accordance with bespoke parameters.

- **C> External Metrics:** It provides a mean to incorporate data from third-party monitoring services into K8s scaling Decision Process.

This type of metrics is particularly useful for scaling decision based on factors that are external to K8s.

- **D> Object Metrics:** These metrics are directly linked to K8s object such as “services” or “ingress”. This metrics can include data-points like number of request per second received by service.
Object Metrics are essential for scaling decision that needs to be aligned with the performance of particular of particular K8s Object providing a focused view of how these objects are handy workloads.

#### Choosing Right Metrics:
- Its not only about defining the “target metrics” and “thresholds” there are multiple operational parameters that influences HPAs behavior.
- Such kind of setup is actually essential to ensure that HPA responds to the real-time needs of application, thereby maintaining optimal performance and resource utilization.
- Sync Period Configuration: This is a flag which is actually used to set at whihc the HPA actually fetches the metrics

```bash
--horizontal-pod-autoscaler-sync-period 
# Default is set to 15 seconds (customizable)
```

#### HPA usage
```bash
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2beta2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: example-hpa
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: example-deployment
  minReplicas: 1
  maxReplicas: 10
  metrics:
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: cpu
      target:
        type: Utilization
        averageUtilization: 50
```

#### Best Practices in HPA
<Image alt="HPA Visualisation" src="/static/images/hpa-explain.jpg" width={1000} height={1000} />
- Timely Update the HPA Configuration as per application needs, as the workloads, performance demands changes overtime.
- Have only 1 HPA targeting specific resource ore Deployment; using multiple may lead to the conflict as HPA may attempt to scale resource based on different criteria resulting in erratic scaling behavior.
- If there need to be consideration of multiple metrics for scaling decision they should be embodied into one HPA Configuration.
